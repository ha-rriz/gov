## WARNING | THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLY OLD LOL

Some code might not work on newer versions of dependencies. Some code is also coded horribly. I am sorry.
This game is from 2022, I have since learnt to code better.

Welcome to Government Mayhem (v1): the game where society is horrible

### What is this?

Government Mayhem is a game where users can control a virtual city. The game has many features, such as:

- Starting a war by laying off every single worker
- Using cats for production (not exactly the best image...)
- Destroying buildings which cannot be rebuilt
- Buying upgrades
- Mining money!
- Having the news hate you!

### So uhh... how do I use this?

Clone this archive with either git or github.

Next, run "npm i" to install all dependencies (DO NOT UPGRADE! UNSURE IF IT WORKS ON CURRENT VERSIONS!)
*You will need node and npm installed.*

Then just run node index! You're done!
